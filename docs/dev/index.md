# Extended Utility Functions

The utility functions described in this section are not part of WorkAdventure core solution.
Instead, they are provided in a separate NPM package called [Scripting API Extra](https://github.com/workadventure/scripting-api-extra).

In this section, you will find a list of these extended functions.

## Importing the "utility functions"

Import these functions in your project using NPM:

```
npm install --save @workadventure/scripting-api-extra
```

Note: these functions are provided as an ES6 module. You will need a "bundler" (like Webpack) to package your script.
If you don't have a bundler already, have a look at the [WorkAdventure Map Starter Kit](https://github.com/workadventure/map-starter-kit/).
It provides a complete development environment ready with Typescript enabled.

For a complete installation guide here, check the "[About the extended features](index.md#importing-the-scripting-api-extra-library)" documentation
