# Binding variables to properties

{.alert.alert-info}
**Important!** To use variables to properties binding, you need to [import the "Scripting API Extra" script in your map](about.md#importing-the-extended-features)

In WorkAdventure maps, ["variables"](https://workadventu.re/map-building/api-state.md) are used to share a state between 
players.

Using the Scripting API Extra library, you can bind your variables values directly into properties on your map.

In a property of your map, use the `{{{ variableName }}}` to refer to the name of a property.

**Sample**

Let's imagine you want to dynamically change the URL of a co-website based on a variable value.
You can create a new variable named "myWebsiteUrl" and bind it to the `openWebsite` property of your co-website layer.

<figure class="figure">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src="images/variable.png" alt="" />
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">The variable</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="figure">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src="images/templated_property.png" alt="" />
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">The property referring to the variable</figcaption>
</figure>

## Context

You can use template properties in:

- any property of any "tile" layer
- any property of a dynamic "area" object

{.alert.alert-warning}
To use bindings with area objects, you must first set the "dynamic" property to true.

It should be noted that "dynamic" areas are accessible via the scripting API but are not editable in the (upcoming) map editor.

    <figcaption class="figure-caption">The Dynamic custom property</figcaption>
</figure>

## Configuration

Binding variables to properties can make your map reactive to variable changes, but you still need to find a way
to modify the values of variables. There are plenty of ways to do this, including:

- [Using the scripting API](https://workadventu.re/map-building/api-state.md)
- [Using auto-generated configuration screen]() // TODO
- [Using generic action layers](generic-action-layers.md)

## About bindings

Use `{{{ variableName }}}` to refer to a variable name.

Behind the scene the [Mustache templating engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustache_(template_system)) is used.
This means you can use all the features of Mustache like conditional:

`openWebsite: {{#enableWebsite}}https://example.com{{/enableWebsite}}`

The website above will be displayed only if the `enableWebsite` variable is set to `true`.



{.alert.alert-warning}
Be sure to use `{{{ variableName }}}` for binding variable and NOT `{{ variableName }}`. The version with a double 
curly-braces will work most of the time, but it escapes HTML characters (which is not needed in properties of a map)
and this might cause weird behaviours (like breaking URLs)


## The special "visible" property

You can control the visibility of a layer with the `visible` **custom** property.

If this custom property is set, it will override the "Visible" property of the layer.

If you bind it to a variable, you can display or hide a layer based on the value of a variable.

<figure class="figure">
    <img class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" src="images/visible_property.png" alt="" />
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Usage of the `visible` property</figcaption>
</figure>

### Inverting a boolean variable

In the example above, the `holeInWall` property is a boolean variable. If it is set to `true`, we want to hide the
layer. So we are setting a `visible` property on the layer. If we put `visible: {{{ holeInWall }}}` the layer
would be visible when `holeInWall` is `true`. But here, we want the opposite: the layer must be displayed when 
`holeInWall` variable is `false`. To do this, we can use Mustache's "inverted sections" (delimited by `{{^variable}}...{{/variable}}`).
This section will be displayed if the variable is false or empty.

Therefore, `{{^holeInWall}}1{{/holeInWall}}` will return "1" when the value of `holeInWall` is false, and will be empty otherwise.
